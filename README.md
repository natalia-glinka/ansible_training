# ansible_training

This is a simple repository to practice very basics of Ansible. :)

The used materials will be as follows:

- [Official documentation](https://docs.ansible.com/)
- [Ansible Galaxy](https://galaxy.ansible.com/ui/standalone/roles/TychoBrouwer/lighttpd/documentation/)
- [My mentor's repository](https://github.com/pawelpiwosz/AnsibleFirstSteps)

Feel free to use it and commit anything you find useful.
